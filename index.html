        <h1>Playing Video Games</h1>
        <p>I like playing video games. My favorite video game is roblox, but I can't play it a lot. So I play Smash Karts a lot. Smash karts is a really fun video game played in rounds in which you collect boxes to get different weapons and you kill peope with those weapons. At the end, once the time ends, whoever got the most kills wins. </p>
